# OS-Tutorial

I followed a PDF to get started writing a bootloader and simple Kernel to run on bare metal hardware.
It follows an x86 architecture, and I am using a cross-compiler to generate the binary files. Steps I still need to take
are writing a keyboard driver to begin implementing a shell environment, and a memory management system for dynamic
allocation.
